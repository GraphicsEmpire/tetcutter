","body":"tetcutter\r\n=========\r\nOne of the main objectives of virtual reality based surgical simulation systems is the removal of pathologic tissue. \r\nCutting imposes many challenges in the development of a robust, interactive surgery \r\nsimulation, not only because of the nonlinear material behavior exhibited by soft tissue but also due to the\r\ncomplexity of introducing the cutting-induced discontinuity. In most publications, the progressive surgical cutting is modelled\r\nby the conventional finite element (FE) method, in which the high computational cost and error accumulation due to remeshing constrain \r\nthe computational efficiency and accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe present a GPU-assisted approach to cutting tetrahedral meshes in real-time. The input to our system is a cut trajectory \r\nand an edge-based data structure representing the tetrahedral mesh. The user moves the cutting tool and the system records the \r\npath of the blade endpoints. The first intersection between the recorded trajectory and the model marks the beginning of the \r\ncutting process. The following steps are performed to complete the cut induced by the scalpel on the mesh:\r\n\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraphicsEmpire/tetcutter/master/data/images/workflow.png)\r\n\r\nCut configurations\r\n=========\r\nCutting a tetrahedra requires a lookup table to handle different cases. This project also helps to identify those cases.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n=========\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraphicsEmpire/tetcutter/master/data/images/dumbel04.png)\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraphicsEmpire/tetcutter/master/data/images/tumor04.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
