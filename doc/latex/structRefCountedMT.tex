\subsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Ownership\+Policy used by Smart\+Ptr Implements external reference counting for multithreaded programs \hyperlink{structPolicy}{Policy} Usage\+: Ref\+Counted\+M\+T\+Adj$<$\+Threading\+Model$>$\+::\+Ref\+Counted\+M\+T

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Warning}
There could be a race condition, see bug \char`\"{}\+Race condition in Ref\+Counted\+M\+T\+Adj\+::\+Release\char`\"{} \href{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1408845&group_id=29557&atid=396644}{\tt http\+://sourceforge.\+net/tracker/index.\+php?func=detail\&aid=1408845\&group\+\_\+id=29557\&atid=396644} As stated in bug 1408845, the Release function is not thread safe if a Smart\+Ptr copy-\/constructor tries to copy the last pointer to an object in one thread, while the destructor is acting on the last pointer in another thread. The existence of a race between a copy-\/constructor and destructor implies a design flaw at a higher level. That race condition must be fixed at a higher design level, and no change to this class could fix it.
