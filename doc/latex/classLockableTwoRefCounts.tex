\subsection{Detailed Description}
This implementation of Strong\+Ptr\textquotesingle{}s Ownership\+Policy uses a pointer to a shared instance of \hyperlink{classLockableTwoRefCountInfo}{Lockable\+Two\+Ref\+Count\+Info}. It behaves very similarly to Two\+Ref\+Counts, except that it provides thread-\/safety. Some functions are trivial enough to be inline, while others are implemented elsewhere.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This class is not designed for use with a single-\/threaded model. Tests using a single-\/threaded model will not run properly, but tests in a multi-\/threaded model with either class-\/level-\/locking or object-\/level-\/locking do run properly.
