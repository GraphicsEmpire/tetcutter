{\ttfamily \#include $<$Strong\+Ptr.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation detail for thread-\/safe reference counting for strong and weak pointers. It uses Two\+Ref\+Count\+Info to manage the pointer and counts. All this does is provide a thread safety mechanism. Since it is just a class for managing implementation details, it is not intended to be used directly -\/ which is why it is in a private namespace. Each instance is a shared resource for all copointers, and there should be only one of these for each set of copointers. This class is small, trivial, and inline.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This class is not designed for use with a single-\/threaded model. Tests using a single-\/threaded model will not run properly, but tests in a multi-\/threaded model with either class-\/level-\/locking or object-\/level-\/locking do run properly.
